## üîê Secret Message Encryption and Decryption Tool
This Python project offers a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages. It uses a character-shifting technique, where each character in the message is shifted by a user-specified key to create an encrypted version. The same key is used to decrypt the message, returning it to its original form.

**How It Works:**
- **Encryption:**
  - The `encrypt` function shifts each character in the message by the key value using its ASCII code.
  - The result is a scrambled (encrypted) message that can only be deciphered by knowing the key.

- **Decryption:**
  - The `decrypt` function reverses the encryption process by shifting each character back by the key value.
  - The output is the original message.

**Usage:**
- **Encryption:**
  - Run the encryption script.
  - Input the message you wish to encrypt.
  - Choose a secret number as the key for encryption.
  - The script will output the encrypted message.
Write your secret message: Hello World
Choose a secret number: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor#Zruog

- **Decryption:**
  - Run the decryption script.
  - Input the encrypted message.
  - Enter the same key used during encryption.
  - The script will output the decrypted (original) message.
Write your encrypted message: Khoor#Zruog
Enter your secret number again: 3
Decrypted message: Hello World

**Features:**
- **Custom Encryption Key:** Allows users to select their own key for message encryption.
